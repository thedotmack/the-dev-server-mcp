# Dev Server Rules

ALWAYS use the-dev-server MCP for dev server management.

## Start Every Conversation
`get-managed-processes()` - check registered servers and status

## User Commands
- "Is it running?" → `get-managed-processes()`
- "Start/stop/restart" → `start-managed-process()` / `stop-managed-process()` / `restart-managed-process()`
- "Add new server" → `register-managed-process()`
- "Change config" → `update-managed-process({...changes, applyToPm2: true})`
- "It's broken" → `diagnose-server` + `read-managed-process-logs()`
- "Remove it" → `delete-managed-process()`

Trust the MCP as the single source of truth.
