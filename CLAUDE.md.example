# Dev Server Management

ALWAYS use the-dev-server MCP to manage dev servers. Check status with `get-managed-processes()`.

## Common Tasks

**Check status:** `get-managed-processes()` - shows registered servers and their status
**First time:** `register-managed-process()` - register a new server
**Start/stop/restart:** `start-managed-process()` / `stop-managed-process()` / `restart-managed-process()`
**Update config:** `update-managed-process({...changes, applyToPm2: true})`
**Debug issues:** `diagnose-server` â†’ `read-managed-process-logs({type: "error"})`
**Remove:** `delete-managed-process()`

Start every conversation with `get-managed-processes()` to see what's running.
